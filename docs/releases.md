# 0.9.6

##Important
* `Through` model for `ManyToMany` relations now **becomes optional**. It's not a breaking change
  since if you provide it everything works just fine as it used to. So if you don't want or need any additional 
  fields on `Through` model you can skip it. Note that it's going to be created for you automatically and 
  still has to be included in example in `alembic` migrations. 
  If you want to delete existing one check the default naming convention to adjust your existing database structure.

  Note that you still need to provide it if you want to 
  customize the `Through` model name or the database table name.

## Features
* Add `update` method to `QuerysetProxy` so now it's possible to update related models directly from parent model
  in `ManyToMany` relations and in reverse `ForeignKey` relations. Note that update like in `QuerySet` `update` returns number of
  updated models and **does not update related models in place** on parent model. To get the refreshed data on parent model you need to refresh
  the related models (i.e. `await model_instance.related.all()`)
* Add `load_all(follow=False, exclude=None)` model method that allows to load current instance of the model
  with all related models in one call. By default it loads only directly related models but setting
  `follow=True` causes traversing the tree (avoiding loops). You can also pass `exclude` parameter
  that works the same as `QuerySet.exclude_fields()` method.
* Added possibility to add more fields on `Through` model for `ManyToMany` relationships:
    * name of the through model field is the lowercase name of the Through class
    * you can pass additional fields when calling `add(child, **kwargs)` on relation (on `QuerysetProxy`)
    * you can pass additional fields when calling `create(**kwargs)` on relation (on `QuerysetProxy`)
        when one of the keyword arguments should be the through model name with a dict of values
    * you can order by on through model fields
    * you can filter on through model fields
    * you can include and exclude fields on through models
    * through models are attached only to related models (i.e. if you query from A to B -> only on B)
    * note that through models are explicitly loaded without relations -> relation is already populated in ManyToMany field. 
    * note that just like before you cannot declare the relation fields on through model, they will be populated for you by `ormar`
    * check the updated ManyToMany relation docs for more information

# 0.9.1

## Features
* Add choices values to `OpenAPI` specs, so it looks like native `Enum` field in the result schema.

## Fixes
* Fix `choices` behavior with `fastapi` usage when special fields can be not initialized yet but passed as strings etc.

# 0.9.0

## Important
* **Braking Fix:** Version 0.8.0 introduced a bug that prevents generation of foreign_keys constraint in the database,
both in alembic and during creation through sqlalchemy.engine, this is fixed now.
* **THEREFORE IF YOU USE VERSION >=0.8.0 YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO UPDATE** cause despite
that most of the `ormar` functions are working your database **CREATED with ormar (or ormar + alembic)** 
  does not have relations and suffer from perspective of performance and data integrity.
* If you were using `ormar` to connect to existing database your performance and integrity 
  should be fine nevertheless you should update to reflect all future schema updates in your models.


## Breaking
* **Breaking:** All foreign_keys and unique constraints now have a name so `alembic` 
  can identify them in db and not depend on db
* **Breaking:** During model construction if `Meta` class of the `Model` does not 
  include `metadata` or `database` now `ModelDefinitionError` will be raised instead of generic `AttributeError`.
* **Breaking:** `encode/databases` used for running the queries does not have a connection pool
for sqlite backend, meaning that each querry is run with a new connection and there is no way to 
  enable enforcing ForeignKeys constraints as those are by default turned off on every connection.
  This is changed in `ormar` since >=0.9.0 and by default each sqlite3 query has `"PRAGMA foreign_keys=1;"`
  run so now each sqlite3 connection by default enforces ForeignKey constraints including cascades.

## Other

* Update api docs.
* Add tests for fk creation in db and for cascades in db

# 0.8.1

## Features

* Introduce processing of `ForwardRef` in relations. 
  Now you can create self-referencing models - both `ForeignKey` and `ManyToMany` relations. 
  `ForwardRef` can be used both for `to` and `through` `Models`.
* Introduce the possibility to perform two **same relation** joins in one query, so to process complex relations like:
  ```
      B = X = Y
    //
   A 
    \
      C = X = Y <= before you could link from X to Y only once in one query
                   unless two different relation were used 
                   (two relation fields with different names)
  ```
* Introduce the `paginate` method that allows to limit/offset by `page` and `page_size`. 
  Available for `QuerySet` and `QuerysetProxy`.

## Other

* Refactoring and performance optimization in queries and joins.
* Add python 3.9 to tests and pypi setup.
* Update API docs and docs -> i.e. split of queries documentation.

# 0.8.0

## Breaking
* **Breaking:** `remove()` parent from child side in reverse ForeignKey relation now requires passing a relation `name`,
as the same model can be registered multiple times and `ormar` needs to know from which relation on the parent you want to remove the child.
* **Breaking:** applying `limit` and `offset` with `select_related` is by default applied only on the main table before the join -> meaning that not the total
  number of rows is limited but just number of main models (first one in the query, the one used to construct it). You can still limit all rows from db response with `limit_raw_sql=True` flag on either `limit` or `offset` (or both)
* **Breaking:** issuing `first()` now fetches the first row ordered by the primary key asc (so first one inserted (can be different for non number primary keys - i.e. alphabetical order of string))
* **Breaking:** issuing `get()` **without any filters** now fetches the first row ordered by the primary key desc (so should be last one inserted (can be different for non number primary keys - i.e. alphabetical order of string))
* **Breaking (internal):** sqlalchemy columns kept at `Meta.columns` are no longer bind to table, so you cannot get the column straight from there

## Features
* Introduce **inheritance**. For now two types of inheritance are possible:
    * **Mixins** - don't subclass `ormar.Model`, just define fields that are later used on different models (like `created_date` and `updated_date` on each child model), only actual models create tables, but those fields from mixins are added
    * **Concrete table inheritance** - means that parent is marked as `abstract=True` in Meta class and each child has its own table with columns from the parent and own child columns, kind of similar to Mixins but parent also is a (an abstract) Model
    * To read more check the docs on models -> inheritance section.
* QuerySet `first()` can be used with `prefetch_related`

## Fixes
* Fix minor bug in `order_by` for primary model order bys
* Fix in `prefetch_query` for multiple related_names for the same model.
* Fix using same `related_name` on different models leading to the same related `Model` overwriting each other, now `ModelDefinitionError` is raised and you need to change the name. 
* Fix `order_by` overwriting conditions when multiple joins to the same table applied.

## Docs
* Split and cleanup in docs:
    *  Divide models section into subsections
    *  Divide relations section into subsections
    *  Divide fields section into subsections
* Add model inheritance section
* Add API (BETA) documentation

# 0.7.5

* Fix for wrong relation column name in many_to_many relation joins (fix [#73][#73])

# 0.7.4

* Allow multiple relations to the same related model/table.
* Fix for wrong relation column used in many_to_many relation joins (fix [#73][#73])
* Fix for wrong relation population for m2m relations when also fk relation present for same model.
* Add check if user provide related_name if there are multiple relations to same table on one model.
* More eager cleaning of the dead weak proxy models.

# 0.7.3

* Fix for setting fetching related model with UUDI pk, which is a string in raw (fix [#71][#71])

# 0.7.2

* Fix for overwriting related models with pk only in `Model.update() with fields passed as parameters` (fix [#70][#70])

# 0.7.1

* Fix for overwriting related models with pk only in `Model.save()` (fix [#68][#68])

# 0.7.0

*  **Breaking:** QuerySet `bulk_update` method now raises `ModelPersistenceError` for unsaved models passed instead of `QueryDefinitionError`
*  **Breaking:** Model initialization with unknown field name now raises `ModelError` instead of `KeyError`
*  Added **Signals**, with pre-defined list signals and decorators: `post_delete`, `post_save`, `post_update`, `pre_delete`, 
`pre_save`, `pre_update`
*  Add `py.typed` and modify `setup.py` for mypy support 
*  Performance optimization
*  Updated docs

# 0.6.2

*  Performance optimization
*  Fix for bug with `pydantic_only` fields being required
*  Add `property_field` decorator that registers a function as a property that will 
   be included in `Model.dict()` and in `fastapi` response
*  Update docs

# 0.6.1

* Explicitly set None to excluded nullable fields to avoid pydantic setting a default value (fix [#60][#60]). 

# 0.6.0

*  **Breaking:** calling instance.load() when the instance row was deleted from db now raises `NoMatch` instead of `ValueError`
*  **Breaking:** calling add and remove on ReverseForeignKey relation now updates the child model in db setting/removing fk column
*  **Breaking:** ReverseForeignKey relation now exposes QuerySetProxy API like ManyToMany relation
*  **Breaking:** querying related models from ManyToMany cleans list of related models loaded on parent model:
    *  Example: `post.categories.first()` will set post.categories to list of 1 related model -> the one returned by first()
    *  Example 2: if post has 4 categories so `len(post.categories) == 4` calling `post.categories.limit(2).all()` -> will load only 2 children and now `assert len(post.categories) == 2`
*  Added `get_or_create`, `update_or_create`, `fields`, `exclude_fields`, `exclude`, `prefetch_related` and `order_by` to QuerySetProxy 
so now you can use those methods directly from relation  
*  Update docs

# 0.5.5

*  Fix for alembic autogenaration of migration `UUID` columns. It should just produce sqlalchemy `CHAR(32)` or `CHAR(36)`
*  In order for this to work you have to set user_module_prefix='sa.' (must be equal to sqlalchemy_module_prefix option (default 'sa.'))

# 0.5.4

*  Allow to pass `uuid_format` (allowed 'hex'(default) or 'string') to `UUID` field to change the format in which it's saved.
   By default field is saved in hex format (trimmed to 32 chars (without dashes)), but you can pass 
   format='string' to use 36 (with dashes) instead to adjust to existing db or other libraries.
   
   Sample:
   *  hex value = c616ab438cce49dbbf4380d109251dce
   *  string value = c616ab43-8cce-49db-bf43-80d109251dce

# 0.5.3

* Added save status -> you can check if model is saved with `ModelInstance.saved` property
    *  Model is saved after `save/update/load/upsert` method on model
    *  Model is saved after `create/get/first/all/get_or_create/update_or_create` method
    *  Model is saved when passed to `bulk_update` and `bulk_create`
    *  Model is saved after adding/removing `ManyToMany` related objects (through model instance auto saved/deleted)
    *  Model is **not** saved after change of any own field (including pk as `Model.pk` alias)
    *  Model is **not** saved after adding/removing `ForeignKey` related object (fk column not saved)
    *  Model is **not** saved after instantation with `__init__` (w/o `QuerySet.create` or before calling `save`)
*  Added `Model.upsert(**kwargs)` that performs `save()` if pk not set otherwise `update(**kwargs)`
*  Added `Model.save_related(follow=False)` that iterates all related objects in all relations and checks if they are saved. If not it calls `upsert()` on each of them.
*  **Breaking:** added raising exceptions if `add`-ing/`remove`-ing not saved (pk is None) models to `ManyToMany` relation
*  Allow passing dictionaries and sets to fields and exclude_fields
*  Auto translate str and lists to dicts for fields and exclude_fields
*  **Breaking:** passing nested models to fields and exclude_fields is now by related ForeignKey name and not by target model name 
*  Performance optimizations - in modelproxy, newbasemodel - > less queries, some properties are cached on models
*  Cleanup of unused relations code
*  Optional performance dependency orjson added (**strongly recommended**)
*  Updated docs
